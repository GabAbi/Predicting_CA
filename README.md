# Predicting_CA
Predicting Current Ability for players in Football Manager 2022

Current Ability (CA) measures the player`s ability for a specific position. It has  a direct relation with the players attributes (at least the ones that are important for said position). 

This measure is not directly observable in the game. It can be obtained through a series of formulas, but this represents a problem when it comes to scouted players, as scouts can fail depending on their ability and they are a limited resource, that is, even if the report was a 100% accurate, calculating the CA for every player would be very slow. For this reason, I will try to specify a regression model that predicts CA.
